## 🚀 What's Ready to Use

### 1. People Counter - Direction Fixed ✅

**Your Main Entrance camera will now correctly count:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│         MAIN ENTRANCE                │
│                                      │
│    EXIT                    ENTRY     │
│   (OUT) ←─────┊─────→ (IN)          │
│                ┊                     │
│     Outside    ┊    Inside Store    │
│                ┊                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘

Left side → Right side = IN (entering store)
Right side → Left side = OUT (exiting store)
```

**Visual feedback on screen:**
- "LEFT->IN" label
- "OUT<-RIGHT" label
- Green counting line in the middle

### 2. Queue Monitor - ROI Editing ✅

**Your QueueMonitor camera can now have custom zones:**

**Step-by-step for your setup:**

1. **Access Dashboard:**
   ```
   http://182.65.205.121:5001/dashboard
   ```
   (Or use your local network IP to access)

2. **Navigate to Queue Monitor section**

3. **Click "Edit ROI" button** (top-right corner)

4. **Draw Queue Area (Yellow):**
   - Click "Draw Main" button
   - Click on the video to place points around the queue waiting area
   - Create a polygon covering where customers wait
   - 4-6 points usually enough

5. **Draw Counter Area (Cyan):**
   - Click "Draw Secondary" button
   - Click on the video to place points around the service counter
   - Draw tightly around where staff serves customers
   - 3-4 points usually enough

6. **Save:**
   - Click "Save" button
   - Wait for "ROI saved successfully!" message
   - ROI will now persist even after system restart

### 3. Detection Saving - Working ✅

**All detections are automatically saved:**

**Queue Monitor:**
- Triggers when: Queue > 2 people AND Counter ≤ 1 person
- Saves to: `static/detections/QueueMonitor_cam_xxxxx_timestamp.jpg`
- Viewable in: Dashboard → Queue Monitor → Detection History

**Storage location:**
```
/home/abhijith/Sakshi-21-OCT/static/detections/
```

**Database records:**
- Table: `detections`
- Includes: app_name, channel_id, timestamp, message, media_path

### 4. Server IP - Auto-configured ✅

**Automatically works with your server IP:**
- Dashboard: `http://182.65.205.121:5001/dashboard`
- Socket.IO: Automatically connects to `182.65.205.121:5001`
- Video feeds: Work through same IP
- No manual configuration needed!

**Also works from:**
- Local: `http://localhost:5001`
- LAN: `http://192.168.x.x:5001`
- Any hostname/IP you use to access

---

## 📋 To Activate Changes

### Option 1: Restart Python Application
```bash
cd /home/abhijith/Sakshi-21-OCT

# Stop current application (Ctrl+C if running in terminal)
# Or kill the process:
pkill -f main_app.py

# Start again
python main_app.py
```

### Option 2: Restart Docker (if using Docker)
```bash
cd /home/abhijith/Sakshi-21-OCT
docker-compose restart
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: People Counter Direction
1. Access: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5001/dashboard`
2. Go to "People Counter" section (Main Entrance camera)
3. Watch the video feed:
   - Should see green vertical line
   - Should see "LEFT->IN" and "OUT<-RIGHT" labels
4. Have someone walk across the line:
   - Left to Right → IN count increases ✅
   - Right to Left → OUT count increases ✅

### Test 2: Queue Monitor ROI
1. Go to "Queue Monitor" section
2. Click "Edit ROI" button
3. Draw Main ROI (yellow) around queue area
4. Draw Secondary ROI (cyan) around counter
5. Click "Save"
6. Verify polygons appear on live video

### Test 3: Queue Alert Detection
1. Have 3+ people stand in queue area (yellow ROI)
2. Have 0-1 people at counter (cyan ROI)
3. Wait 3 seconds
4. Alert should trigger
5. Check "Detection History" - image should appear

### Test 4: Remote Access
1. From another computer on network:
   ```
   http://182.65.205.121:5001/dashboard
   ```
2. Verify all video feeds load
3. Verify real-time counts update
4. Check browser console for Socket.IO connection

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Main Entrance (PeopleCounter)
```
Display on screen:
- IN: XXX (Green color)
- OUT: XXX (Orange color)
- LEFT->IN label (right side)
- OUT<-RIGHT label (left side)
- Green vertical line (center)

Updates:
- Real-time Socket.IO updates
- Saves to database every hour
- Persists across day changes
```

### QueueMonitor
```
Display on screen:
- Queue: XX (Yellow color)
- Counter Area: X (Cyan color)
- Yellow polygon (queue ROI)
- Cyan polygon (counter ROI)
- Yellow boxes around people in queue
- Cyan boxes around people at counter

Alerts:
- Triggers when queue > 2, counter ≤ 1
- Saves image to detections folder
- Shows in Detection History
- 3-minute cooldown between alerts
```

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Connecting:
```bash
# Test RTSP stream
ffplay rtsp://admin:cctv%231234@182.65.205.121:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0

# Check if accessible
ping 182.65.205.121
```

### Direction Still Wrong:
```
1. Ensure you restarted the application
2. Check video feed shows new labels
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check logs for errors
```

### ROI Not Saving:
```bash
# Check database connection
psql -U postgres -d sakshi -h 127.0.0.1

# Check table exists
\dt roi_configs

# Check permissions
ls -la /home/abhijith/Sakshi-21-OCT/static/detections/
```

### Socket.IO Not Connecting:
```javascript
// Check browser console
// Should see: "✅ Socket.IO connected successfully"
// If not, check firewall allows port 5001
```
