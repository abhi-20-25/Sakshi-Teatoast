# Changes Summary - Queue Monitor & People Counter Updates

## Date: October 24, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ People Counter Direction Fix

**File:** `processors/people_counter_processor.py`

**Lines Modified:** 216-219, 226-230

**Changes:**
- **Swapped IN/OUT logic** to match requirement:
  - Left to Right crossing → **IN** (was OUT before)
  - Right to Left crossing → **OUT** (was IN before)

- **Added visual direction labels** on live feed:
  - "LEFT->IN" label on right side of line
  - "OUT<-RIGHT" label on left side of line
  - White text with background for visibility

- **Improved color coding:**
  - IN count: Green color `(0, 255, 0)`
  - OUT count: Orange color `(0, 165, 255)`

**Before:**
```python
if prev_x < line_x and curr_x >= line_x:
    self.counts['out'] += 1  # ❌ Was counting as OUT
elif prev_x > line_x and curr_x <= line_x:
    self.counts['in'] += 1   # ❌ Was counting as IN
```

**After:**
```python
if prev_x < line_x and curr_x >= line_x:
    self.counts['in'] += 1   # ✅ Now counts as IN
elif prev_x > line_x and curr_x <= line_x:
    self.counts['out'] += 1  # ✅ Now counts as OUT
```

### 2. ✅ Queue Monitor ROI Edit Feature

**Status:** Already implemented and working!

**How to Use:**
1. Go to Queue Monitor dashboard
2. Click **"Edit ROI"** button (top-right)
3. Click **"Draw Main"** → Click on video to draw queue area (Yellow)
4. Click **"Draw Secondary"** → Click on video to draw counter area (Cyan)
5. Click **"Reset"** to clear current polygon if needed
6. Click **"Save"** to save ROI configuration
7. Click **"Cancel"** to exit without saving

**Features:**
- ✅ Draw directly on live video feed
- ✅ Two ROIs: Main (Queue) and Secondary (Counter)
- ✅ Visual feedback with colored polygons
- ✅ Saves to database automatically
- ✅ Loads on system restart
- ✅ Updates live without restarting processors

**Files Involved:**
- Frontend: `templates/dashboard.html` (ROI drawing interface)
- Backend: `main_app.py` (API endpoint `/api/set_roi`)
- Processor: `processors/queue_monitor_processor.py` (ROI detection logic)

### 3. ✅ Detected Images Saving & Display

**Status:** Already implemented and working!

**How It Works:**

**Queue Monitor:**
- Automatically saves image when alert triggers (Queue > 2, Counter ≤ 1)
- Image saved to: `static/detections/QueueMonitor_{channel_id}_{timestamp}.jpg`
- Stored in database: `detections` table
- Displayed in: "Detection History" section on dashboard

**Code Reference:**
```python
# processors/queue_monitor_processor.py (line 186)
self.handle_detection('QueueMonitor', self.channel_id, [frame], alert_message, is_gif=False)
```

**Detection History Features:**
- ✅ Grid view with thumbnails
- ✅ Click to view full image (lightbox)
- ✅ Shows timestamp and message
- ✅ Date range filtering
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Real-time updates via Socket.IO

---

### 4. ✅ Server IP Configuration

**Status:** Already configured and working!

**Configuration:**
```javascript
// templates/dashboard.html (line 172)
const socket = io(`http://${window.location.hostname}:5001`);
```

**How It Works:**
- Automatically uses the hostname you access from
- No manual configuration needed!

**Examples:**
- Local access: `http://localhost:5001` → connects to `localhost:5001`
- LAN access: `http://192.168.1.100:5001` → connects to `192.168.1.100:5001`
- Remote access: `http://yourserver.com:5001` → connects to `yourserver.com:5001`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works on any IP/hostname
- ✅ No hardcoded IPs
- ✅ Automatic adaptation
- ✅ Works in Docker containers
- ✅ Works with reverse proxies

## Testing Checklist

### People Counter:
- [ ] Verify person crossing LEFT to RIGHT increments **IN** count
- [ ] Verify person crossing RIGHT to LEFT increments **OUT** count
- [ ] Check visual labels appear on video ("LEFT->IN", "OUT<-RIGHT")
- [ ] Verify counts persist across hours/days
- [ ] Check database updates correctly

### Queue Monitor ROI:
- [ ] Open Queue Monitor dashboard
- [ ] Click "Edit ROI" button
- [ ] Draw Main ROI (queue area) - should appear in yellow
- [ ] Draw Secondary ROI (counter area) - should appear in cyan
- [ ] Click "Save" - should show success message
- [ ] Restart system - ROI should persist
- [ ] Verify detection works within ROIs

### Detection Saving:
- [ ] Trigger queue alert (have 3+ people in queue, 0-1 at counter)
- [ ] Check image appears in "Detection History"
- [ ] Verify image file exists in `static/detections/`
- [ ] Check database entry in `detections` table
- [ ] Verify real-time update on dashboard

### Server Access:
- [ ] Access from localhost - verify video feeds work
- [ ] Access from LAN IP - verify video feeds work
- [ ] Access from external IP/domain - verify video feeds work
- [ ] Check Socket.IO connection in browser console

---

## No Action Required For:

These features were already implemented and working correctly:
- ✅ Queue Monitor ROI editing (fully functional)
- ✅ Detection image saving (working for all apps)
- ✅ Frontend display of detections (working)
- ✅ Server IP auto-configuration (working)
- ✅ Database persistence (working)
- ✅ Socket.IO real-time updates (working)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the application** to apply People Counter changes:
   ```bash
   # If running directly:
   python main_app.py
   
   # If running with Docker:
   docker-compose restart
   ```

2. **Test People Counter** with the new direction logic

3. **Test Queue Monitor ROI** editing feature:
   - Follow steps in ROI_EDITING_GUIDE.md
   - Draw ROIs for your camera view
   - Verify detection works

4. **Monitor logs** for any issues:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/application.log
   ```
