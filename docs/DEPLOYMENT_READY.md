## 🎯 Configuration Examples for Your Cameras

### Main Entrance (Channel 1) - People Counter:
```
Use Case: Store entrance monitoring
Line: Vertical, positioned at doorway
Left → Right = IN (entering store)
Right → Left = OUT (leaving store)
```

### Queue Area (Channel 5) - Queue Monitor:
```
Use Case: Queue and counter monitoring

Queue ROI (Yellow):
- Draw around entire waiting area
- Example: 4 points covering queue zone

Counter ROI (Cyan):
- Draw tightly around service counter
- Example: Small box where staff serves

Settings:
- Queue Alert Threshold: 2 (alert when 2+ people waiting)
- Counter Threshold: 1 (alert if ≤1 person at counter)
- Dwell Time: 3 seconds (ignore passers-by)
- Alert Cooldown: 180 seconds (3 minutes between alerts)
```

2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify backend is running: `ps aux | grep main_app`

### Issue: Video not showing in modal
**Fix:**
1. Check video feed works on main dashboard
2. Verify: `http://182.65.205.121:5001/video_feed/QueueMonitor/cam_xxxxx`
3. Check camera connectivity
4. Check backend logs: `tail -f logs/app.log`

### Issue: Points not appearing
**Fix:**
1. Wait for image to load (1-2 seconds)
2. Canvas sizes after image loads
3. Click anywhere on video area
4. Check JavaScript console for errors

### Issue: Settings don't save

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Queue Detection:
1. ✅ Draw queue ROI during quiet periods
2. ✅ Test with actual customers
3. ✅ Avoid overlapping queue and counter areas
4. ✅ Set dwell time based on your queue speed:
   - Fast-moving queue: 2-3 seconds
   - Slow queue: 5-10 seconds
5. ✅ Adjust thresholds based on traffic patterns

### For Best People Counting:
1. ✅ Position line perpendicular to traffic flow
2. ✅ Ensure line spans entire walking path
3. ✅ Use vertical for side-to-side traffic
4. ✅ Use horizontal for up-down traffic
5. ✅ Test both directions after positioning

### For Best Performance:
1. ✅ Use wired network connection (not WiFi)
2. ✅ Keep camera resolution at 1080p or lower
3. ✅ Ensure good lighting for better detection
4. ✅ Minimize camera vibration/movement
5. ✅ Monitor server CPU/memory usage
